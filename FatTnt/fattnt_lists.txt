LICENSE [LICENSE PENDING]
--------------------------
Something minimal on top of what can be done with a Bukkit/CraftBukkit plugin.
Supposedly this would range from public domain (probably not) to somewhere around MIT license.
Actually it is safe to assume MIT license, but if the license can be "less", i will probably make it so.



 Features: 
 - select what entities are handled (tnt, creeper?)
 - configure: block resistance (strength)
 - modifiers for explosion radius and damage
 - Let explosions go through blocks without destruction (configurable, defaults to: lava, water, bedrock, other).
 - damage living entities according to the arriving strength of the explosion, not the distance to the center.
 - Fires EntityExplodeEvent and EntityDamageEvent and allows canceling by other plugins.
 - API might be used by other events to trigger explosions.
 
 
 Issues:
! (bugfix) propagation differs concerning x / z !.
 ! Velocity cap + maybe flags what to apply it to / when
 ! Sand/TNT spazzing: First set blocks without physics, then later apply physics [physics might be scheduled to the next tick ...]?
 ! Must add: fire, if fire is set.
 ! adjust default values to something realistic...
 ! Re-think event priorities and canceling to allow other plugins canceling the ExplosionPrimeEvent as well [Probably ok with highest].
 ! Re-think which events to intercept: [Currently for performance reason TNTPrimed is canceled always, to prevent calculations for the explosion being done by CraftBukkit or MC] 
 ? Allow arbitrary strength (but limit radius) ?
 ? flag: alwaysIncludeTNT -> even if resistance of tnt is to high still add tnt.
 ! flag: only apply velocity if damage event is not canceled !
 
 Planned:
 ! Random tick delay for primed tnt.
 ! add configuration flag for enabled (need not be changed by commands).
 ! MAKE SETTINGE DETACHED , default, world specific, ... further ...
 ? Damage or change  entities according to their type (TNT->Explode, ItemStacks - damage)
 ! More fine grained vector manipulation 
 ! Use velocity events if possible !
 ! add explosions on water : do allow config option to only damage entities.
 ! More events (+configurable if, also for the old ones !) like ItemSpawn or similar.
 ! direct explode feature (threshold + possibly with probabilities: 1. p(direct) -> if not... maybe prime)
 ! Explosion API: add call with exploding entitytype as argument [exists already], but with flag to create that entity temporarily
 
 Maybe:
 ? More custom settings to allow for adding fire or whatever to certain or all explosions.
 ! Fire custom event allowing for adjusting manipulations in a more fine grained way (!)
 ? configure maximum radius to be handled and if to be aborted otherwise.
 ? propagate explosion slowly ?
 ? Schedule TNT option (limit to n per tick)
 ? use lock + exception later on for API access
 ? prime tnt from itm drops or when in fire?
 ? other explosion shaping
